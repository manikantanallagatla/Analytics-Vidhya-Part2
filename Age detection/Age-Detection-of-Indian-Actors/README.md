# Age-Detection-of-Indian-Actors

Challenge link on Analytics Vidhya : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-age-detection/

Problem Statement : Classifying faces of Indian film actors/actresses according to their age. Images are taken from IMFDB (http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/IMFDB/)

Papers relevant to this problem are added : 

- Paper introducing IMFDB dataset 
- Paper explaining Viola-Jones algorithm for real-time object detection


## Experiments to try :

- [DONE] Deep CNNs with and w/o Dropout
- [DONE] Deep CNNs, Dropout + Data augmentation
- [DONE] Autoencoders for denoising
- [DONE] Using advanced activation layers in Keras (PReLU, ELU, LeakyReLU)
- CNN with SVM loss function at the top
- Pre-trained models
- Implementation of face detection algorithms (Viola-Jones, HoG etc.)
